Project InsightBot

InsightBot is designed to be a personalized knowledge assistant. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers based on your own documents.

Key features include:
- Document ingestion from various formats (PDF, TXT).
- Smart document chunking for efficient information retrieval.
- Utilization of vector databases (ChromaDB) for semantic search.
- Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for generating responses.

The project is built with Python, LangChain, OpenAI, ChromaDB, and Streamlit for the user interface. Our goal is to make it production-ready with thorough testing and clear documentation.

Future enhancements may include support for more document types, advanced chunking strategies, and different LLM providers.
